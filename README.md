# Google Data Analytics Capstone: Bellabeat Case Study
Hi! Welcome to my Google Data Analytics capstone case study! This case study showcases my thought process and data analysis skills as an aspiring junior data analyst. Google Sheets, BigQuery, Tableau, Google Slides, and Google Docs were all used to complete this case study and complete the full data analysis process.

This case study utilized a public FitBit dataset found on Kaggle to extract insights that could lead to another fitness smart device company's, Bellabeat's, potential growth. Each part of the data analysis process from asking and setting up the proper business task, preparing and evaluating the quality of data, cleaning and processing data, analyzing data, visualizing data, and sharing and acting upon analysis results was described in detail in the uploaded report..

The files uploaded to this repository involve a pdf report of the case study and a pdf slideshow presentation with the relevant visualizations that were created in Tableau. Here is the Tableau public link as well:
